## Problem statement

You need to build a simplified version of a social networking website (like Twitter.com) with the following features.

**Product Features:**

1. Signup
2. Login/Logout
3. Post a status update
4. Follow other users
5. View a feed of the status updates of the users you are following *(Optional)*

## Backend

The problem statement, involved emphasing on the fact of a simple authorisation with respect to the feeds. The backend architecture involved making separate collections for User, Posts and Feedbacks for the simple reason to scale according to the situation. Furthermore, Backend architecture involves a clean architecture along with using typescript and proper commenting for understanding the code. The backend api have focused on all features such as login/logout, CRUD Operations on respective User, Posts and Follows. The same can availed from the postman documentation [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10696212/2s8Ysuxt8Y) 

Note: The Sign in by Google is implemented though, only specific accounts are allowed to use. Hence, It’s was avoided in the deployment.

## Frontend

The above picture depicts my condition in implementing Frontend. My health wasn’t good since the last week, though I tried my best to complete the frontend features. The code is novice for anyone with little knowledge of React, HTML/CSS. The below are the features for the application

## Get all the people you might follow

Note: By a single click of the button, The User is following the other user, The change of text from Follow to Following is not implemented. Hence, Multiple request to follow will answer in an alert

## Message for the Squareboat Team

Hey Team,

It was really an amazing experience working on the problem statement. The task was new to me from every aspect of my coding experience. I actually learnt a lot about implementation of these system in the architecture. I’ll really hope to have a next round of discussion on my work and discuss to make it more robust. Your feedbacks will surely be appreciated. 

Thank You,
Deepankar
